Bedrock,Amazon Nova Lite,eu-central-1,Input Tokens,500000,"1,000,000.00",value,$0.525000000,"Amazon Bedrock pricing varies by service: text models (Nova Lite, Pro, Reel) are billed per token for input, cache hits, and output, with Lite being cheaper but slower, while Pro/Reel cost more for better quality; text-to-image (Nova Canvas) charges per image, with higher resolution and quality driving up cost; video (Nova Reel) charges per generated second, with resolution and fps multipliers; and knowledge bases are billed per query, with extra charges when retrieval-augmented generation (embeddings + vector store) is used. In practice, the billing units boil down to tokens, images, seconds, and queries, where higher quality or advanced features increase spend—making batching strategies and cache utilization key for cost optimization at scale."
