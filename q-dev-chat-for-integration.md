Lets make a major integration with the backend
I&#39;ve been given this json to work with 
api-schema.json

I want you to take a deep look at it and also look at the current UI we have
Then you can outline a plan and path with files to create and logics to write which will make everything functional with no mock data anymore but actual communication with the backend 

Then report back
Don&#39;t modify code ywt

---

I'll analyze the API schema and examine the current UI to create a comprehensive integration plan. Let me start by reading the complete API schema and exploring the current codebase structure.

---

Now let me explore the current UI structure to understand what we're working with:

---

Let me examine the current API client and key components to understand the existing structure:

---

Let me examine the smart data collection and processing components to understand the current flow:

---

Now let me check the queries file to understand the current API integration:

---

Now let me examine the enhanced results component to see how results are currently displayed:

---

Now let me check the package.json to understand the current dependencies:

---


Based on my analysis of the API schema and current UI, I can now provide you with a comprehensive integration plan. Here's my assessment and roadmap:

## üìã **BACKEND INTEGRATION ANALYSIS & PLAN**

### **Current State Assessment:**
- ‚úÖ UI has sophisticated multi-step campaign workflow
- ‚úÖ React Query setup for API management  
- ‚úÖ File upload infrastructure partially implemented
- ‚ùå **Using outdated/incorrect API endpoints**
- ‚ùå **No integration with new API schema endpoints**
- ‚ùå **Mock data throughout the application**

### **API Schema Integration Requirements:**

The new API provides 4 key endpoints:
1. **Presigned URL Generation** (`/api/upload/presigned-url`)
2. **Upload Status Check** (`/api/upload`)  
3. **Basic Campaign Generation** (`/api/campaigns`)
4. **Comprehensive Campaign Generation** (`/api/comprehensive-campaign`)

---

## üéØ **INTEGRATION ROADMAP**

### **Phase 1: Core API Infrastructure**

**Files to Create/Modify:**

1. **`lib/api-config.ts`** - New centralized API configuration
2. **`lib/api-client.ts`** - Complete rewrite with new endpoints
3. **`lib/types.ts`** - TypeScript interfaces for API responses
4. **`lib/queries.ts`** - Update React Query hooks for new API

### **Phase 2: Image Upload Integration**

**Files to Modify:**

1. **`components/smart-data-collection.tsx`** - Integrate real S3 upload flow
2. **`hooks/use-upload.ts`** - New custom hook for upload management

**Logic to Implement:**
- Presigned URL request ‚Üí S3 direct upload ‚Üí Status polling
- Real-time upload progress tracking
- Error handling and retry logic

### **Phase 3: Campaign Generation Integration**

**Files to Modify:**

1. **`components/ai-collaboration-processing.tsx`** - Replace mock processing with real API calls
2. **`components/enhanced-results.tsx`** - Handle real API response structure

**Logic to Implement:**
- Choose between basic vs comprehensive campaign endpoints
- Handle 15-40 second response times with proper loading states
- Parse JSON string responses from comprehensive endpoint

### **Phase 4: Data Flow & State Management**

**Files to Modify:**

1. **`app/campaign/page.tsx`** - Update state management for real data flow
2. **`lib/campaign-store.ts`** - New Zustand store for campaign state (optional)

---

## üîß **KEY INTEGRATION POINTS**

### **1. Upload Flow Transformation:**
```
Current: Mock file handling
New: File ‚Üí Presigned URL ‚Üí S3 Upload ‚Üí Status Check ‚Üí Campaign Generation
```

### **2. Campaign Generation Logic:**
```
Basic Campaign: Simple product info ‚Üí /api/campaigns
Comprehensive: Product info + S3 image ‚Üí /api/comprehensive-campaign
```

### **3. Response Handling:**
```
Current: Mock structured data
New: Parse JSON strings from API, handle cultural adaptations, market trends
```

### **4. Loading States:**
```
Current: Simulated progress
New: Real progress tracking with proper timeouts (15-40s)
```

---

## üìÅ **FILES TO CREATE (8 files):**

1. `lib/api-config.ts` - API configuration
2. `lib/types.ts` - TypeScript interfaces  
3. `hooks/use-upload.ts` - Upload management
4. `hooks/use-campaign.ts` - Campaign generation
5. `lib/upload-utils.ts` - Upload utilities
6. `lib/campaign-utils.ts` - Campaign processing utilities
7. `components/upload-progress.tsx` - Real upload progress component
8. `lib/error-handling.ts` - Centralized error handling

## üìù **FILES TO MODIFY (6 files):**

1. `lib/api-client.ts` - Complete rewrite
2. `lib/queries.ts` - Update for new endpoints
3. `lib/config.ts` - Update API URLs
4. `components/smart-data-collection.tsx` - Real upload integration
5. `components/ai-collaboration-processing.tsx` - Real API processing
6. `components/enhanced-results.tsx` - Handle real response structure

---

## ‚ö° **CRITICAL INTEGRATION CHALLENGES:**

1. **Response Time Management** - Handle 15-40 second API calls
2. **JSON String Parsing** - Comprehensive endpoint returns JSON as string
3. **Error Handling** - Implement proper retry logic and user feedback
4. **File Size Limits** - 10MB limit enforcement
5. **Rate Limiting** - Respect API rate limits (5-100 req/min)

---

## üöÄ **IMPLEMENTATION PRIORITY:**

**High Priority:**
- API configuration and client setup
- Image upload flow with S3 integration
- Basic campaign generation endpoint

**Medium Priority:**  
- Comprehensive campaign generation
- Enhanced error handling and retry logic
- Loading state improvements

**Low Priority:**
- Performance optimizations
- Advanced caching strategies
- Analytics integration

This plan will transform your application from using mock data to fully functional backend integration while maintaining the existing sophisticated UI experience. The key is implementing the upload flow first, then progressively enhancing the campaign generation capabilities.

Would you like me to proceed with implementing any specific phase of this integration plan?

Question, if we&#39;re to include actual video or image content as part of the results from one of the 3 goals, what should I tell the backend ( looking at the UI) 
Because he says what does the flow look like concerning that and I should document it and send to him

---


Looking at the UI and API schema, here's the **Video/Image Content Generation Flow** documentation for your backend developer:

## üìã **CONTENT GENERATION FLOW DOCUMENTATION**

### **Current UI Goals That Need Content Generation:**

1. **"Viral Content Creation"** - Needs video scripts, thumbnails, and visual assets
2. **"Global Viral Campaign"** - Needs culturally adapted video/image content per region  
3. **"Improve Existing Performance"** - Needs optimized visual content based on competitor analysis

---

## üéØ **EXPECTED CONTENT TYPES FROM BACKEND:**

### **Video Content:**
```json
{
  "video_scripts": [
    {
      "platform": "tiktok",
      "duration": "15-30s",
      "script": "Hook + Product demo + CTA",
      "visual_cues": ["Close-up shot", "Transition effect"],
      "music_suggestion": "Upbeat trending audio"
    }
  ],
  "video_thumbnails": [
    {
      "platform": "youtube", 
      "thumbnail_url": "https://s3.../generated-thumbnail.jpg",
      "title_overlay": "Best Coffee Maker 2024!"
    }
  ]
}
```

### **Image Content:**
```json
{
  "social_media_posts": [
    {
      "platform": "instagram",
      "image_url": "https://s3.../generated-post.jpg", 
      "caption": "Generated caption text",
      "hashtags": ["#coffee", "#lifestyle"]
    }
  ],
  "ad_creatives": [
    {
      "format": "square_1080x1080",
      "image_url": "https://s3.../ad-creative.jpg",
      "headline": "Transform Your Morning Routine"
    }
  ]
}
```

---

## üîÑ **PROPOSED BACKEND FLOW:**

### **Step 1: Content Generation Request**
When user completes campaign setup, frontend sends:
```json
{
  "product": {...},
  "target_markets": [...],
  "campaign_goals": [...],
  "s3_image_key": "uploads/...",
  "content_requirements": {
    "generate_videos": true,
    "generate_images": true,
    "platforms": ["tiktok", "instagram", "youtube"],
    "content_types": ["scripts", "thumbnails", "social_posts", "ads"]
  }
}
```

### **Step 2: Backend Processing**
1. **Image Analysis** - Analyze uploaded product image
2. **Content Generation** - Use Bedrock to generate scripts/copy
3. **Visual Asset Creation** - Generate thumbnails, social posts, ad creatives
4. **S3 Storage** - Store generated assets in S3
5. **Response Assembly** - Return URLs and metadata

### **Step 3: Enhanced API Response**
Current `parsed_content_structure` should include:
```json
{
  "generated_assets": {
    "videos": {
      "scripts": [...],
      "thumbnails": [...]
    },
    "images": {
      "social_posts": [...],
      "ad_creatives": [...],
      "infographics": [...]
    }
  }
}
```

---

## üé® **UI DISPLAY REQUIREMENTS:**

### **Current UI Expects:**
- **Downloadable assets** (images, video scripts as PDF)
- **Preview thumbnails** for generated content
- **Platform-specific formatting** (Instagram square, YouTube thumbnail, etc.)
- **Copy-paste ready scripts** and captions

### **Frontend Will Handle:**
- Asset preview and download
- Platform-specific display formatting  
- User feedback and regeneration requests

---

## ‚ö° **TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS:**

### **File Formats:**
- **Images:** JPG/PNG (optimized for web)
- **Videos:** MP4 (if generating actual videos) or JSON scripts
- **Documents:** PDF for scripts/copy

### **S3 Structure:**
```
generated-assets/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ {campaign_id}/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ images/
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ social-posts/
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ad-creatives/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ videos/
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ scripts/
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ thumbnails/
```

### **Response Time:**
- Add **+10-15 seconds** to current processing time for content generation
- Update loading states to show "Generating visual assets..."

---

## üöÄ **IMPLEMENTATION PRIORITY:**

**Phase 1:** Text-based content (scripts, captions, copy)
**Phase 2:** Static image generation (social posts, thumbnails)  
**Phase 3:** Advanced visual assets (infographics, animated thumbnails)

This flow ensures the UI can display rich, actionable content that users can immediately use for their campaigns, rather than just strategy recommendations.

---

Okay back to the integration, still looking at api-schema.json
What I&#39;m being told is to go ahead with that integration but the backend will provide as part of the response, the thumbnail and image assets and so for now lets use placeholders but expecting that the thumbnail and image assets will come later

So go ahead with the integration we spoke about earlier so that with just a click of a button, everything should be generated for them

Note: that the second goal, &quot;boost your social performance&quot; should be on hold for now
but its going to be that we pull out existing campaigns for the user and expect a url to the post of youtube then they choose what campaign they want to optimize then we go and optimize for them

But for now the other two goals should work with real integrations

---
